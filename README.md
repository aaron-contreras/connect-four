## Gameplay details
- The grid is __7-columns__ wide by __6-rows__ tall.
- Pieces "fall" straight down occupying the _lowest available space_.
- __Objective__: Be the first to form a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line with four of one's own discs. If the board fills up without a player reaching four consecutive discs in-a-row, then the game is a draw.
